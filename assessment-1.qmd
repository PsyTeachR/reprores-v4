# Assessment 1

A project with a qmd file showing basic reproducible report skills

## Instructions

Your task is to write the outline structure of your thesis report in a reproducible quarto script. The report must contain the following:

* [ ] A *project structure* with all needed files (@sec-project-start)
* [ ] A *setup code chunk* that loads the tidyverse (@sec-setup-chunk)
* [ ] The main *section headers* that you expect to use in your report (i.e., Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion, References) (@sec-markdown)
* [ ] A short *paragraph* about your research topic in the Introduction section, using markdown syntax for any text formatting (@sec-markdown)
* [ ] Use *inline R* to include the version of R you are using in the Methods section (@sec-inline-r)
* [ ] A *table* in the Methods section that gives a rough timetable for your thesis, created using markdown or data frames in R (@sec-md-tables)
* [ ] One relevant *image* (or your favourite stats/coding meme) with a figure caption (@sec-md-images) in the Results section
* [ ] *Cross reference* the image in the text with automatic figure numbering (@sec-cross-references)
* [ ] At least two *bibliographic references* cited in the text, created and displayed in the reference section using reproducible techniques (@sec-bibliography)
* [ ] Customise the *YAML header* (@sec-yaml) to: 
    - [ ] a table of contents (@sec-toc)
    - [ ] display tables using kable 
    - [ ] use a non-default theme of your choosing 
    - [ ] hide all code chunks
* [ ] The quarto file should be renderable by the marker (@sec-render)

See [this report](demos/report1.html) for an example.

## Submission

* Due: Wednesday, 2024-10-09 by noon
* Covers: chapters 1 and 2
* Worth: 10%
* Do not put your name in your report; use your student ID as the author.
* Please submit a **zip file** containing: 
  1. the .rproj file
  2. your reproducible script, named `report1_studentID.qmd`
  3. any additional files necessary to reproduce your report (e.g., images or bibliography files),
  4. the rendered html report, named `report1_studentID.html`.

## Marking Rubric

You will receive green/amber/red lights for each of 11 elements, and a generic feedback document explaining common issues. Each rubric element is weighted equally. 

* Green: Perfect or nearly perfect
* Amber: Needs some improvement
* Red: Incorrect or absent
